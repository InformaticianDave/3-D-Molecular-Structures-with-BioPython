# 3-D-Molecular-Structures-with-BioPython
Biopython is a collection of open-source computational implementations that can be use in evolutionary, molecular biology, and other disciplines. A highly versatile and complex platform, Biopython is use to develop modules, classes, parsers and other tools with which biological research is streamlined as well as simplified. Biopython allows its user to utilize bioinformatics files such as FASTA. The platform also connects to various open-source databases and resources for further research. With the right modules, a bioinformaticians can find sequences, perform alignments, build phylogenetic trees, assess length between nodes, project tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins, and more.
